        <p> Hello, World! Welcome to my portfolio. As you have noticed my name is Jazmin, I've been on earth for about
            25
            years. While I'm here I partake in spicy foods, progressive reads, dancing for free, and stretching my body
            to
            some mantras. I've lived and traveld from such places as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Martinez,CA, Arizona,
            Angel City
            Philippines, Briefly Vancouver, Canada and recently moved back to my hometown of Riverside CA. When I'm not
            doing yoga outdoors, and pushing
            myself just enough to believe I am flexable, I'm getting ready and putting together creative/abstract
            outfits to show the world. You can
            find me at a tiny hole-in-the-wall bar, secret shows in random locations, interpersonal venues with my
            favorite electronic artists. Surley,
            you can't forget the 80's tribute nights and spending time with the LGBTQ community. However, When I'm not
            ruleing the nightlife you can find me at a local coffee shop, thrift stores, or the great outdoors.
            I believe in loving every moment of your life. That belief stems from great authors, and public speakers.
            With those beliefs I landed in the web-dev world and greatly look forward to learning many other languages
            to help businesses around the world. Since "Everybody wants to rule the world."
